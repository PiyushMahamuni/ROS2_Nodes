*** INSTALL ROS2 FOXY FITZROY ON UBUNTU

	Just go to the ros.org for ROS2 installation and follow the instructions.
	https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html
	
	After complete installation, to be able to use ros2 and it's functionalities you'll have to setup environment variables
	To do this, you just need to source the setup.bash file from your main installation location /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
	*Make sure if you're using multiple versions of ros (ros1 and ros2) to carefully edit .bashrc if you've done so to not
	source mismatching setup files and not setup environment variables for more than 1 version at the same time. This will cause
	errors
	
	I have declared aliases for sourcing different versions of ros. That way I can still easily switch/create new terminals
	while using ROS
